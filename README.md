# Temperature Converter

> This is a quick python application that queries the user to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice versa.  
> Once the user has selected the type of conversion required, the program queries the user for a temperature  
> input, and then converts the temperature to the desired unit and displays the result with a precision of two  
> decimal places.  The program repeats until the user chooses not to.
